title: Clinical Relevance Score for Guided Trauma Injury Pattern Discovery with Weakly
  Supervised $β$-VAE
abstract: 'Given the complexity of trauma presentations, particularly in those involving
  multiple areas of the body, overlooked injuries are common during the initial assessment
  by a clinician.  We are motivated to develop an automated trauma pattern discovery
  framework for comprehensive identification of injury patterns which may eventually
  support diagnostic decision-making.  We analyze 1,162,399 patients from the Trauma
  Quality Improvement Program with a disentangled variational autoencoder, weakly
  supervised by a latent-space classifier of auxiliary features. We also develop a
  novel scoring metric that serves as a proxy for clinical intuition in extracting
  clusters with clinically meaningful injury patterns. We validate the extracted clusters
  with clinical experts, and explore the patient characteristics of selected groupings.  Our
  metric is able to perform model selection and effectively filter clusters for clinically-validated
  relevance. '
