title: 'Neural Fine-Gray: Monotonic neural networks for competing risks'
abstract: Time-to-event modelling, known as survival analysis, differs from standard
  regression as it addresses \emph{censoring} in patients who do not experience the
  event of interest. Despite competitive performances in tackling this problem, machine
  learning methods often ignore other \emph{competing risks} that preclude the event
  of interest. This practice biases the survival estimation. Extensions to address
  this challenge often rely on parametric assumptions or numerical estimations leading
  to sub-optimal survival approximations. This paper leverages constrained monotonic
  neural networks to model each competing survival distribution. This modelling choice
  ensures the exact likelihood maximisation at a reduced computational cost by using
  automatic differentiation. The effectiveness of the solution is demonstrated on
  one synthetic and three medical datasets. Finally, we discuss the implications of
  considering competing risks when developing risk scores for medical practice.
