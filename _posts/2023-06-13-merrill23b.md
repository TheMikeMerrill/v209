title: 'Homekit2020: A Benchmark for Time Series Classification on a Large Mobile
  Sensing Dataset with Laboratory Tested Ground Truth of Influenza Infections'
abstract: 'Despite increased interest in wearables as tools for detecting various
  health conditions, there are not as of yet any large public benchmarks for such
  mobile sensing data. The few datasets that \textit{are} available do not contain
  data from more than dozens of individuals, do not contain high-resolution raw data
  or do not include dataloaders for easy integration into machine learning pipelines.
  Here, we present Homekit2020: the first large-scale public benchmark for time series
  classification of wearable sensor data. Our dataset contains over 14 million hours
  of minute-level multimodal Fitbit data, symptom reports, and ground-truth laboratory
  PCR influenza test results, along with an evaluation framework that mimics realistic
  model deployments and efficiently characterizes statistical uncertainty in model
  selection in the presence of extreme class imbalance. Furthermore, we implement
  and evaluate nine neural and non-neural time series classification models on our
  benchmark across 450 total training runs in order to establish state of the art
  performance.'
