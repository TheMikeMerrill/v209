title: Evaluating Model Performance in Medical Datasets Over Time
abstract: Machine learning (ML) models deployed in healthcare systems must face data
  drawn from continually evolving environments. However,  researchers proposing  such
  models typically evaluate them in a time-agnostic manner, splitting datasets  according
  to patients sampled randomly  throughout the entire study time period.  This work
  proposes the Evaluation on Medical Datasets Over Time (EMDOT) framework,  which
  evaluates the performance of a model class across time.  Inspired by the concept
  of backtesting,  EMDOT simulates possible training procedures that practitioners  might
  have been able to execute at each point in time and evaluates the resulting models
  on all future time points.  Evaluating both linear and more complex models on six
  distinct medical data sources (tabular and imaging), we % show how depending on
  the dataset,  using all historical data may be ideal in many cases,  whereas using
  a window of the most recent data could be advantageous in others.  In datasets  %
  where models suffer from sudden degradations in performance, we investigate plausible
  explanations for these shocks. We release the EMDOT package to help facilitate  further
  works in deployment-oriented evaluation over time.
