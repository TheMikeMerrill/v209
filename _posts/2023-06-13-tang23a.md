title: Modeling Multivariate Biosignals With Graph Neural Networks and Structured
  State Space Models
abstract: Multivariate biosignals are prevalent in many medical domains, such as electroencephalography,
  polysomnography, and electrocardiography. Modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in
  multivariate biosignals is challenging due to (1) long-range temporal dependencies
  and (2) complex spatial correlations between the electrodes. To address these challenges,
  we propose representing multivariate biosignals as time-dependent graphs and introduce
  \textsc{GraphS4mer}, a general graph neural network (GNN) architecture that improves
  performance on biosignal classification tasks by modeling spatiotemporal dependencies
  in biosignals. Specifically, (1) we leverage the Structured State Space architecture,
  a state-of-the-art deep sequence model, to capture long-range temporal dependencies
  in biosignals and (2) we propose a graph structure learning layer in \textsc{GraphS4mer}
  to learn dynamically evolving graph structures in the data.  We evaluate our proposed
  model on three distinct biosignal classification tasks and show that \textsc{GraphS4mer}
  consistently improves over existing models, including (1) seizure detection from
  electroencephalographic signals, outperforming a previous GNN with self-supervised
  pre-training by 3.1 points in AUROC; (2) sleep staging from polysomnographic signals,
  a 4.1 points improvement in macro-F1 score compared to existing sleep staging models;
  and (3) 12-lead electrocardiogram classification, outperforming previous state-of-the-art
  models by 2.7 points in macro-F1 score.
