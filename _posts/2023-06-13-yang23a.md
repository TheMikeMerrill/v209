title: "\\ours: Pre-Train Graph Neural Networks for Brain Network Analysis"
abstract: 'The human brain is the central hub of the neurobiological system, controlling
  behavior and cognition in complex ways. Recent advances in neuroscience and neuroimaging
  analysis have shown a growing interest in the interactions between brain regions
  of interest (ROIs) and their impact on neural development and disorder diagnosis.
  As a powerful deep model for analyzing graph-structured data, Graph Neural Networks
  (GNNs) have been applied for brain network analysis. However, training deep models
  requires large amounts of labeled data, which is often scarce in brain network datasets
  due to the complexities of data acquisition and sharing restrictions.  To make the
  most out of available training data, we propose \ours, a GNN pre-training framework
  that captures intrinsic brain network structures, regardless of clinical outcomes,
  and is easily adaptable to various downstream tasks. \ours comprises two key components:
  (1) an unsupervised pre-training technique designed specifically for brain networks,
  which enables learning from large-scale datasets without task-specific labels; (2)
  a data-driven parcellation atlas mapping pipeline that facilitates knowledge transfer
  across datasets with different ROI systems. Extensive evaluations using various
  GNN models have demonstrated the robust and superior performance of \ours compared
  to baseline methods.'
