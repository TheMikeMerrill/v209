title: Towards the Practical Utility of Federated Learning in the Medical Domain
abstract: 'Federated learning (FL) is an active area of research. One of the most
  suitable areas for adopting FL is the medical domain, where patient privacy must
  be respected. Previous research, however, does not provide a practical guide to
  applying FL in the medical domain. We propose empirical benchmarks and experimental
  settings for three representative medical datasets with different modalities: longitudinal
  electronic health records, skin cancer images, and electrocardiogram signals. The
  likely users of FL such as medical institutions and IT companies can take these
  benchmarks as guides for adopting FL and minimize their trial and error. For each
  dataset, each client data is from a different source to preserve real-world heterogeneity.
  We evaluate six FL algorithms designed for addressing data heterogeneity among clients,
  and a hybrid algorithm combining the strengths of two representative FL algorithms.
  Based on experiment results from three modalities, we discover that simple FL algorithms
  tend to outperform more sophisticated ones, while the hybrid algorithm consistently
  shows good, if not the best performance. We also find that a frequent global model
  update leads to better performance under a fixed training iteration budget. As the
  number of participating clients increases, higher cost is incurred due to increased
  IT administrators and GPUs, but the performance consistently increases. We expect
  future users will refer to these empirical benchmarks to design the FL experiments
  in the medical domain considering their clinical tasks and obtain stronger performance
  with lower costs.'
