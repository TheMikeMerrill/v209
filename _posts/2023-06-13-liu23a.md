title: Adaptive Weighted Multi-View Clustering
abstract: Learning multi-view data is an emerging problem in machine learning research,
  and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular dimensionality-reduction
  method for integrating information from multiple views. These views often provide
  not only consensus but also complementary information. However, most multi-view
  NMF algorithms assign equal weight to each view or tune the weight via line search
  empirically, which can be infeasible without any prior knowledge of the views or
  computationally expensive.  In this paper, we propose a weighted multi-view NMF
  (WM-NMF) algorithm.  In particular, we aim to address the critical technical gap,
  which is to learn both view-specific weight and observation-specific reconstruction
  weight to quantify each view’s information content. The introduced weighting scheme
  can alleviate unnecessary views’ adverse effects and enlarge the positive effects
  of the important views by assigning smaller and larger weights, respectively. Experimental
  results confirm the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms
  of achieving better clustering performance and dealing with the noisy data compared
  to the existing algorithms.
