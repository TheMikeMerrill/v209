title: Contrastive Learning of Electrodermal Activity Representations for Stress Detection
abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a biosignal that contains valuable information
  for monitoring health conditions related to sympathetic nervous system activity.
  Analyzing ambulatory EDA data is challenging because EDA measurements tend to be
  noisy and sparsely labeled. To address this problem, we present the first study
  of contrastive learning that examines approaches that are tailored to the EDA signal.
  We present a novel set of data augmentations that are tailored to EDA, and use them
  to generate positive examples for unsupervised contrastive learning. We evaluate
  our proposed approach on the downstream task of stress detection. We find that it
  outperforms baselines when used both for fine-tuning and for transfer learning,
  especially in regimes of high label sparsity. We verify that our novel EDA-specific
  augmentations add considerable value beyond those considered in prior work through
  a set of ablation experiments.
