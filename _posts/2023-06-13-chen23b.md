title: A General Framework for Visualizing Embedding Spaces of\titlebreak Neural Survival
  Analysis Models Based on Angular Information
abstract: We propose a general framework for visualizing any intermediate embedding
  representation used by any neural survival analysis model. Our framework is based
  on so-called \emph{anchor directions} in an embedding space. We show how to estimate
  these anchor directions using clustering or, alternatively, using user-supplied
  “concepts” defined by collections of raw inputs (e.g., feature vectors all from
  female patients could encode the concept “female”). For tabular data, we present
  visualization strategies that reveal how anchor directions relate to raw clinical
  features and to survival time distributions. We then show how these visualization
  ideas extend to handling raw inputs that are images. Our framework is built on looking
  at angles between vectors in an embedding space, where there could be “information
  loss” by ignoring magnitude information. We show how this loss results in a “clumping”
  artifact that appears in our visualizations, and how to reduce this information
  loss in practice.
