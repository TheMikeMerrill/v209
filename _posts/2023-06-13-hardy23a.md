title: Who Controlled the Evidence? Question Answering for Disclosure Information
  Extraction
abstract: Conflict of interest (COI) disclosure statements provide rich information
  to support transparency and reduce bias in research. We introduce a novel task to
  identify relationships between sponsoring entities and the research studies they
  sponsor from the disclosure statement. This task is challenging due to the complexity
  of recognizing all potential relationship patterns and the hierarchical nature of
  identifying entities first and then extracting their relationships to the study.
  To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we also constructed a new annotated
  dataset and proposed a Question Answering-based method to recognize entities and
  extract relationships. Our method has demonstrated robustness in handling diverse
  relationship patterns, and it remains effective even when trained on a low-resource
  dataset.
