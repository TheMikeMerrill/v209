title: Leveraging an Alignment Set in Tackling Instance-Dependent Label Noise
abstract: Noisy training labels can hurt model performance. Most approaches that aim
  to address label noise assume label noise is independent from the input features.
  In practice, however, label noise is often feature or \textit{instance-dependent},
  and therefore biased (i.e., some instances are more likely to be mislabeled than
  others). E.g., in clinical care, female patients are more likely to be under-diagnosed
  for cardiovascular disease compared to male patients. Approaches that ignore this
  dependence can produce models with poor discriminative performance, and in many
  healthcare settings, can exacerbate issues around health disparities. In light of
  these limitations, we propose a two-stage approach to learn in the presence instance-dependent
  label noise. Our approach utilizes \textit{\anchor points}, a small subset of data
  for which we know the observed and ground truth labels. On several tasks, our approach
  leads to consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art in discriminative performance
  (AUROC) while mitigating bias (area under the equalized odds curve, AUEOC). For
  example, when predicting acute respiratory failure onset on the MIMIC-III dataset,
  our approach achieves a harmonic mean (AUROC and AUEOC) of 0.84 (SD [standard deviation]
  0.01) while that of the next best baseline is 0.81 (SD 0.01).  Overall, our approach
  improves accuracy while mitigating potential bias compared to existing approaches
  in the presence of instance-dependent label noise.
