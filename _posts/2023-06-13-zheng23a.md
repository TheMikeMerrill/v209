title: Machine Learning for Arterial Blood Pressure Prediction
abstract: 'High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease,
  necessitating accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement. Clinicians measure BP with
  an invasive arterial catheter or via a non-invasive arm or finger cuff. However,
  the former can cause discomfort to the patient and is unsuitable outside Intensive
  Care Unit (ICU). While cuff-based devices, despite being non-invasive, fails to
  provide continuous measurement, and they measure from peripheral blood vessels whose
  BP waveforms differ significantly from those proximal to the heart. Hence, there
  is an urgent need to develop a measurement protocol for converting easily measured
  non-invasive data into accurate BP values. Addressing this gap, we propose a non-invasive
  approach to predict BP from arterial area and blood flow velocity signals measured
  from a Philips ultrasound transducer (XL-143) applied to large arteries close to
  heart. We developed the protocol and collected data from 72 subjects. The shape
  of BP (relative BP) can be theoretically calculated from these waveforms, however
  there is no established theory to obtain \textit{absolute} BP values. To tackle
  this challenge, we further employ data-driven machine learning models to predict
  the Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP), from which the absolute BP can be derived.
  Our study investigates various machine learning algorithms to optimize the prediction
  accuracy. We find that LSTM, Transformer, and 1D-CNN algorithms using the blood
  pressure shape and blood flow velocity waveforms as inputs can achieve 8.6, 8.7,
  and 8.8 mmHg average standard deviation of the prediction error respectively without
  anthropometric data such as age, sex, heart rate, height, weight. Furthermore, the
  1D-CNN model can achieve 7.9mmHg when anthropometric data is added as inputs, improving
  upon an anthropometric-only model of 9.5mmHg. This machine learning-based approach,
  capable of converting ultrasound data into MAP values, presents a promising software
  tool for physicians in clinical decision-making regarding blood pressure management. '
