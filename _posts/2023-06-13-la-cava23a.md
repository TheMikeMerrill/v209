title: Fair admission risk prediction with proportional multicalibration
abstract: 'Fair calibration is a widely desirable fairness criteria in risk prediction
  contexts.  One way to measure and achieve fair calibration is with multicalibration.  Multicalibration
  constrains calibration error among flexibly-defined subpopulations while maintaining
  overall calibration.  However, multicalibrated models can exhibit a higher percent
  calibration error among groups with lower base rates than groups with higher base
  rates.  As a result, it is possible for a decision-maker to learn to trust or distrust
  model predictions for specific groups.  To alleviate this, we propose \emph{proportional
  multicalibration}, a criteria that constrains the percent calibration error among
  groups and within prediction bins.  We prove that satisfying proportional multicalibration
  bounds a modelâ€™s multicalibration as well its \emph{differential calibration}, a
  fairness criteria that directly measures how closely a model approximates sufficiency.  Therefore,
  proportionally calibrated models limit the ability of decision makers to distinguish
  between model performance on different patient groups, which may make the models
  more trustworthy in practice.   We provide an efficient algorithm for post-processing
  risk prediction models for proportional multicalibration and evaluate it empirically.  We
  conduct simulation studies and investigate a real-world application of PMC-postprocessing
  to prediction of emergency department patient admissions. We observe that proportional
  multicalibration is a promising criteria for controlling simultaneous measures of
  calibration fairness of a model over intersectional groups with virtually no cost
  in terms of classification performance.  '
