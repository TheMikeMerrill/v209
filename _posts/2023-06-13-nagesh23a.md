title: Explaining a machine learning decision to physicians via counterfactuals
abstract: 'Machine learning models perform well on several healthcare tasks and can
  help reduce the burden on the healthcare system. However, the lack of explainability
  is a major roadblock to their adoption in hospitals.   \textit{How can the decision
  of an ML model be explained to a physician?}  The explanations considered in this
  paper are counterfactuals (CFs), hypothetical scenarios that would have resulted
  in the opposite outcome. Specifically, time-series CFs are investigated, inspired
  by the way physicians converse and reason out decisions ‘I would have given the
  patient a vasopressor if their blood pressure was lower and falling’.  Key properties
  of CFs that are particularly meaningful in clinical settings are outlined: physiological
  plausibility, relevance to the task and sparse perturbations.  Past work on CF generation
  does not satisfy these properties, specifically plausibility in that realistic time-series
  CFs are not generated. A variational autoencoder (VAE)-based approach is proposed
  that captures these desired properties. The method produces CFs that improve on
  prior approaches quantitatively (more plausible CFs as evaluated by their likelihood
  w.r.t original data distribution, and 100$\times$ faster at generating CFs) and
  qualitatively (2$\times$ more plausible and relevant)  as evaluated by three physicians.'
