title: Bayesian Active Questionnaire Design for Cause-of-Death Assignment Using Verbal
  Autopsies
abstract: Only about one-third of the deaths worldwide are assigned a medically-certified
  cause, and understanding the causes of deaths occurring outside of medical facilities
  is logistically and financially challenging. Verbal autopsy (VA) is a routinely
  used tool to collect information on cause of death in such settings. VA is a survey-based
  method where a structured questionnaire is conducted to family members or caregivers
  of a recently deceased person, and the collected information is used to infer the
  cause of death. As VA becomes an increasingly routine tool for cause-of-death data
  collection, the lengthy questionnaire has become a major challenge to the implementation
  and scale-up of VA interviews as they are costly and time-consuming to conduct.
  In this paper, we propose a novel active questionnaire design approach that optimizes
  the order of the questions dynamically to achieve accurate cause-of-death assignment
  with the smallest number of questions. We propose a fully Bayesian strategy for
  adaptive question selection that is compatible with any existing probabilistic cause-of-death
  assignment methods. We also develop an early stopping criterion that fully accounts
  for the uncertainty in the model parameters. We also propose a penalized score to
  account for constraints and preferences of existing question structures. We evaluate
  the performance of our active designs using both synthetic and real data, demonstrating
  that the proposed strategy achieves accurate cause-of-death assignment using considerably
  fewer questions than the traditional static VA survey instruments.
