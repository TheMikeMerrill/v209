title: 'Missing Values and Imputation in Healthcare Data:  Can Interpretable Machine
  Learning Help?'
abstract: Missing values are a fundamental problem in data science. Many datasets
  have missing values that must be properly handled because the way missing values
  are treated can have large impact on the resulting machine learning model. In medical
  applications, the consequences may affect healthcare decisions. There are many methods
  in the literature for dealing with missing values, including state-of-the-art methods
  which often depend on black-box models for imputation. In this work, we show how
  recent advances in interpretable machine learning provide a new perspective for
  understanding and tackling the missing value problem. We propose methods based on
  high-accuracy glass-box Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) that can help users
  (1) gain new insights on missingness mechanisms and better understand the causes
  of missingness, and (2) detect – or even alleviate – potential risks introduced
  by imputation algorithms. Experiments on real-world medical datasets illustrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
