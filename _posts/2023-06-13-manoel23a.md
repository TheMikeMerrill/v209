title: Federated Multilingual Models for Medical Transcript Analysis
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that allows the model
  trainer to access more data samples by training across multiple decentralized data
  sources while enforcing data access constraints. Such trained models can achieve
  significantly higher performance beyond what can be done when trained on a single
  data source. In a FL setting, none of the training data is ever transmitted to any
  central location; i.e. sensitive data remains local and private. These characteristics
  make FL perfectly suited for applications in healthcare, where a variety of compliance
  constraints restrict how data may be handled. Despite these apparent benefits in
  compliance and privacy, certain scenarios such as heterogeneity of the local data
  distributions pose significant challenges for FL. Such challenges are even more
  pronounced in the case of a multilingual setting. This paper presents a FL system
  for pre-training a large-scale multi-lingual model suitable for fine-tuning on downstream
  tasks such as medical entity tagging. Our work represents one of the first such
  production-scale systems, capable of training across multiple highly heterogeneous
  data providers, and achieving levels of accuracy that could not be otherwise achieved
  by using central training with public data only. We also show that the global model
  performance can be further improved by a local training step.
