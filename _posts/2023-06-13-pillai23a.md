title: Rare Life Event Detection via Mobile Sensing Using Multi-Task Learning
abstract: Rare life events significantly impact mental health, and their detection
  in behavioral studies is a crucial step towards health-based interventions. We envision
  that mobile sensing data can be used to detect these anomalies. However, the human-centered
  nature of the problem, combined with the infrequency and uniqueness of these events
  makes it challenging for unsupervised machine learning methods. In this paper, we
  first investigate granger-causality between life events and human behavior using
  sensing data. Next, we propose a multi-task framework with an unsupervised autoencoder
  to capture irregular behavior, and an auxiliary sequence predictor that identifies
  transitions in workplace performance to contextualize events. We perform experiments
  using data from a mobile sensing study comprising N=126 information workers from
  multiple industries, spanning 10106 days with 198 rare events ($<2%$). Through personalized
  inference, we detect the exact day of a rare event with an F1 of 0.34, demonstrating
  that our method outperforms several baselines. Finally, we discuss the implications
  of our work from the context of real-world deployment.
