title: 'Collecting data when missingness is unknown: a method for improving model
  performance given under-reporting in patient populations'
abstract: Machine learning models for healthcare commonly use binary indicator variables
  to represent the diagnosis of specific health conditions in medical records. However,
  in populations with significant under-reporting, the absence of a recorded diagnosis
  does not rule out the presence of a condition, making it difficult to distinguish
  between negative and missing values. This effect,  which we refer to as latent missingness,
  may lead to model degradation and perpetuate existing biases in healthcare. To address
  this issue, we propose that healthcare providers and payers  allocate a budget towards
  data collection (eg. subsidies for check-ups or lab tests). However, given finite
  resources, only a subset of data points can be collected. Additionally, most models
  are unable to be re-trained after deployment. In this paper, we propose a method
  for efficient data collection in order to maximize a fixed modelâ€™s performance on
  a given population. Through simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate the potential
  value of targeted data collection to address model degradation.
