title: 'Semantic match: Debugging feature attribution methods \titlebreak in XAI for
  healthcare'
abstract: The recent spike in certified Artificial Intelligence tools for healthcare
  has renewed the debate around adoption of this technology. One thread of such debate
  concerns Explainable AI and its promise to render AI devices more transparent and
  trustworthy. A few voices active in the medical AI space have expressed concerns
  on the reliability of Explainable AI techniques and especially feature attribution
  methods, questioning their use and inclusion in guidelines and standards. We characterize
  the problem as a lack of semantic match between explanations and human understanding.
  To understand when feature importance can be used reliably, we introduce a distinction
  between feature importance of low- and high-level features. We argue that for data
  types where low-level features come endowed with a clear semantics, such as tabular
  data like Electronic Health Records, semantic match can be obtained, and thus feature
  attribution methods can still be employed in a meaningful and useful way. For high-level
  features, we sketch a procedure to test whether semantic match has been achieved.
