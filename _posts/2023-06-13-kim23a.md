title: 'Revisiting Machine-Learning based Drug Repurposing: Drug Indications Are Not
  a Right Prediction Target'
abstract: 'In this paper, we challenge the utility of approved drug indications as
  a prediction target for machine learning in drug repurposing (DR) studies. Our research
  highlights two major limitations of this approach: 1) the presence of strong confounding
  between drug indications and drug characteristics data, which results in shortcut
  learning, and 2) inappropriate normalization of indications in existing drug-disease
  association (DDA) datasets, which leads to an overestimation of model performance.
  We show that the collection patterns of drug characteristics data were similar within
  drugs of the same category and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification
  of drugs could be predicted by using the data collection patterns. Furthermore,
  we confirm that the performance of existing DR models is significantly degraded
  in the realistic evaluation setting we proposed in this study. We provide realistic
  data split information for two benchmark datasets, Fdataset and deepDR dataset.'
