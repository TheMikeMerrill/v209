title: Token Imbalance Adaptation for Radiology Report Generation
abstract: 'Imbalanced token distributions naturally exist in text documents, leading
  neural language models to overfit on frequent tokens. The token imbalance may dampen
  the robustness of radiology report generators, as complex medical terms appear less
  frequently but reflect more medical information. In this study, we demonstrate how
  current state-of-the-art models fail to generate infrequent tokens on two standard
  benchmark datasets (IU X-RAY and MIMIC-CXR) of radiology report generation. To solve
  the challenge, we propose the \textbf{T}oken \textbf{Im}balance Adapt\textbf{er}
  (\textit{TIMER}), aiming to improve generation robustness on infrequent tokens.
  The model automatically leverages token imbalance by an unlikelihood loss and dynamically
  optimizes generation processes to augment infrequent tokens.  We compare our approach
  with multiple state-of-the-art methods on the two benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model robustness overall and infrequent
  tokens. Our ablation analysis shows that our reinforcement learning method has a
  major effect in adapting token imbalance for radiology report generation. '
