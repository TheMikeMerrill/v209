title: 'MultiWave: Multiresolution Deep Architectures through Wavelet Decomposition
  for Multivariate Time Series Prediction'
abstract: The analysis of multivariate time series data is challenging due to the
  various frequencies of signal changes that can occur over both short and long terms.
  Furthermore, standard deep learning models are often unsuitable for such datasets,
  as signals are typically sampled at different rates. To address these issues, we
  introduce MultiWave, a novel framework that enhances deep learning time series models
  by incorporating components that operate at the intrinsic frequencies of signals.
  MultiWave uses wavelets to decompose each signal into subsignals of varying frequencies
  and groups them into frequency bands. Each frequency band is handled by a different
  component of our model. A gating mechanism combines the output of the components
  to produce sparse models that use only specific signals at specific frequencies.
  Our experiments demonstrate that MultiWave accurately identifies informative frequency
  bands and improves the performance of various deep learning models, including LSTM,
  Transformer, and CNN-based models, for a wide range of applications. It attains
  top performance in stress and affect detection from wearables. It also increases
  the AUC of the best-performing model by 5% for in-hospital COVID-19 mortality prediction
  from patient blood samples and for human activity recognition from accelerometer
  and gyroscope data. We show that MultiWave consistently identifies critical features
  and their frequency components, thus providing valuable insights into the applications
  studied.
