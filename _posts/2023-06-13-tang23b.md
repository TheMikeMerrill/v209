title: "\\ours: Mobile Sensing based Fluid Overload Detection for End Stage Kidney
  Disease Patients using \\underlineSensor \\underlineRelation \\underlineDual \\underlineAutoencoder"
abstract: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a life-threatening and prevalent disease.
  CKD patients, especially end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients on hemodialysis,
  suffer from kidney failures and are unable to remove excessive fluid, causing fluid
  overload and multiple morbidities including death. Current solutions for fluid overtake
  monitoring such as ultrasonography and biomarkers assessment are cumbersome, discontinuous,
  and can only be performed in the clinic. In this paper, we propose \ours, a latent
  graph learning powered fluid overload detection system based on \underline{S}ensor
  \underline{R}elation \underline{D}ual \underline{A}utoencoder to detect excessive
  fluid consumption of EKSD patients based on passively collected bio-behavioral data
  from smartwatch sensors. Experiments using real-world mobile sensing data indicate
  that \ours outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both F1 score and recall,
  and demonstrate the potential of ubiquitous sensing for ESKD fluid intake management.\looseness=-1
